# Another Report Reference
There's another report example given in the CDE4301 Course briefing on Canvas (Slide 28) that uses sidebar navigation for contents page which feels more readable. <br>

The link to the report I'm referring is the **FIRST** link in slide **28** of the [CDE4301 Course briefing slides on Canvas](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/77869/files?preview=6996665) (i.e. ASI-401 link).
