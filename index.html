        <h2>Abstract (Sammi)</h2>
        <p>
          Indoor air pollution has become a critical yet often overlooked environmental and public health concern, particularly in
          high-density urban regions such as Singapore, where individuals spend up to 90% of their time indoors. Among the various
          pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from common household items like paints, adhesives, furnishings,
          and cleaning agents, pose significant health risks, ranging from respiratory irritation to carcinogenic effects.
          Conventional air-cleaning systems, including activated carbon filters and photocatalytic purifiers, are limited by
          energy consumption, maintenance needs, and by-product formation. This project explores a plant–microbe biofiltration
          approach as a sustainable, low-energy alternative for VOC removal. Leveraging the synergistic relationship between
          plants and rhizospheric microorganisms, the system enables continuous biodegradation of VOCs into harmless compounds
          without secondary waste generation. Through phased research involving plant selection, pilot testing, and
          proof-of-concept validation, this study investigates the effectiveness of different plant–microbe pairings in reducing
          concentrations of five key VOCs—formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (FBTEX). The findings aim to
          inform the development of a scalable, self-sustaining indoor air purification system that enhances air quality, supports
          occupant well-being, and aligns with Singapore’s broader sustainability and low-carbon urban design goals.

      <div id="1. Introduction">
        <h2> 1. Introduction (Sammi)</h2>
      <div id="1.1 Indoor Air Quality and Pollutants">
        <h3>1.1 Indoor Air Quality and Pollutants</h3>
        <p>
          Air quality is fundamental to human health and well-being, influencing respiratory, cardiovascular, and even cognitive
          functions (World Health Organization, 2025). While outdoor air pollution has long received attention due to its visible
          impacts, such as smog, haze, and poor air quality indices, it represents only part of the exposure picture. Indoor air
          quality (IAQ), by contrast, remains an underappreciated but equally critical aspect of environmental health (Dcarrick,
          2024). Indoor pollutants are often invisible, odorless, and difficult to detect without monitoring. (US EPA, 2025).
        </p> 
        <p> 
          In the context of Singapore, focusing on indoor air quality is particularly crucial. The country ranks fourth globally
          among surveyed nations for having indoor air that is worse than outdoor air, underscoring the extent of exposure within
          enclosed spaces (Air Quality Connected Data Study, 2024). Due to its tropical climate, dense urban landscape, and heavy
          reliance on air-conditioning, Singaporeans spend up to 90% of their time indoors, breathing an estimated 11,000 litres
          of air each day (BCA, 2020; Lung Basic, n.d.). Much of this exposure occurs in offices, schools, homes, and shopping
          malls, where mechanical ventilation systems dominate and pollutant accumulation is common (Pedro et al., 2024c).
          Understanding the main types and sources of indoor air pollutants is therefore essential to address the underlying
          causes of poor air quality and its health implications.
        </p>
        Indoor air pollution can be broadly categorized into two main groups: particulate matter and gaseous
        contaminants:<br><br>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Particulate Matter (PM)</strong>
          <p>
            PM refers to a complex mixture of microscopic solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. These
            particles can originate from both outdoor and indoor sources. From the outdoor environment, PM can enter indoor spaces
            through openings such as doors and windows. Indoor sources include biological materials like pollens, mold spores, and
            dust mites, while human activities such as cooking or burning candles can further contribute to particulate generation.
            Prolonged exposure to PM has been associated with several adverse health effects, including increased respiratory
            symptoms, nonfatal heart attacks, and aggravated asthma (California Air Resources Board, 2015).
          </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>Gaseous Contaminants</strong>
          <p>
            Gaseous contaminants consist of both inorganic and organic gases that pose significant health risks in indoor
            environments. Inorganic gases, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon oxides (COx), are reactive gases commonly
            produced by gas-fueled cooking and heating appliances, as well as cooking stoves, tobacco smoke, and outdoor air
            infiltration. Prolonged exposure to these gases can lead to respiratory symptoms, fatigue, chest pain, and even reduced
            brain function and impaired vision (Tran, Park, &amp; Lee, 2020).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        On the other hand, organic gases, primarily volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are carbon-based compounds released from
        numerous indoor sources. These include printers, building materials, and furnishings, as well as household products such
        as paints, pesticides, dyes, and cleaning agents. Exposure to VOCs can cause eye, nose, and throat irritation,
        headaches, loss of coordination, and nausea. Long-term exposure may result in damage to the liver, kidney, and nervous
        system, and has been linked to an increased risk of cancer (Tran, Park, &amp; Lee, 2020).<br><br></div>

      <div id="1.2 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in Air">
        <h3>1.2 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in Air</h3>
        <p>
          When comparing the different groups of indoor air pollutants, organic gases such as VOCs exhibit the highest
          indoor-to-outdoor concentration ratio, highlighting their strong indoor presence (Air Quality Expert Group, 2022).
          Studies have shown that indoor VOC levels are typically two to five times higher than outdoor concentrations, and may
          spike even higher in sealed or air-conditioned buildings with poor ventilation (US EPA, 2025). Unlike particulate
          matter or inorganic gases that may dissipate quickly, VOCs can persist for months or even years because they are
          continuously emitted from sources such as paints, furniture, adhesives, cleaning agents, and building materials, which
          is shown to reaching as high as 19 µg/m³ (Zuraimi, Tham, & Sekhar, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
          In indoor air, there are a large group of hundreds over different types of VOCs present, which makes it impossible to
          know specifically on the number of types of VOCs in a certain room as every environment is different. However, these 5
          types of VOCs (Formaldehyde, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene (FBTEX)) are among the most frequently-detected
          and health-relevant indoor VOCs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Formaldehyde, commonly emitted from building materials, pressed-wood furniture, coatings and adhesives, is a
          well‐documented irritant to the eyes, nose and throat and has been classified as a probable human carcinogen even at
          relatively low concentrations (Kaden, Mandin, Nielsen, & Wolkoff, 2010). In large-scale studies across Europe, Asia
          and North America, indoor formaldehyde concentrations in homes have commonly ranged from about 10 to 40 μg/m³, with
          upper 95th percentile values above 50 μg/m³ in some case-studies (Canada, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the BTEX group are aromatic hydrocarbons produced by solvent use, paints and adhesives, indoor combustion
          sources and infiltration from vehicle exhaust or attached garages (Vardoulakis et al., 2020). Indoor benzene levels
          typically span 2 to 12 μg/m³ in non-smoking homes in Europe, with occasional higher peaks associated with smoking or
          fuel exhaust infiltration (Harrison, Saborit, Dor, & Henderson, 2010).
        </p>
        <p>
          They are frequently used as indicator compounds for indoor VOC pollution and have been shown to pose both
          non-carcinogenic (neurological, respiratory) and carcinogenic (e.g., benzene to leukemia) risks in indoor settings.
          Their high vapour pressure means they readily partition into air, especially in poorly ventilated indoor spaces,
          leading to concentrations that may significantly exceed outdoor levels (Baberi et al., 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, focus should be given to these 5 types of VOCs; Formaldehyde and BTEX. These VOCs are the most common and
          harmful indoor VOCs. These pollutants are released from everyday materials present in almost every residence. By
          studying these five compounds, our project targets the key contributors to poor indoor air quality, helping us develop
          effective ways to monitor, reduce, and prevent VOC build-up in indoor environments.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="1.3 Impacts of VOC">
        <h3>1.3 Impacts of VOC</h3>
        <p>
          Exposure to VOCs can lead to a broad spectrum of adverse effects. 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Health Impacts</strong>
          <p>
          Short-term exposure commonly causes eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches, nausea, and dizziness, while
          long-term exposure is linked to damage of the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system and increased cancer risk from
          compounds such as benzene and formaldehyde (Lai, 2025).
          </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Environmental Impacts</strong>
          <p>
            In Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) monitors key VOCs, particularly benzene, toluene, and xylene
            (BTX), as they react with nitrogen oxides under sunlight to form ground-level ozone and photochemical smog, which
            degrade air quality and visibility (NEA, 2024).
          </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>Productivity and Cognitive Impact</strong>
          <p>
            Beyond health effects, VOC exposure also influences productivity and cognitive performance. A study by Nanyang
            Technological University (NTU) reported that elevated indoor VOC levels correlate with reduced concentration, memory,
            and creative task performance, underscoring the direct link between indoor air quality and workplace efficiency
            (ScienceDaily, 2023).
          </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Economic Impact</strong>
          <p>
            Industry sources indicate that VOC-related emissions from furniture and building materials are linked to reduced
            workplace productivity, increased sick leave and higher healthcare costs (SFIC, 2025).&nbsp; According to The Societal
            Cost of Modifiable Risk Factors in Singapore (2019), air pollution accounted for approximately S$506 million (95% UI
            S$458–588 million) in combined healthcare and productivity losses (Tan et al., 2023).
          </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        Collectively, these findings underscore that VOCs pose not only a public health threat but also a broader environmental
        and economic concern, with implications that extend beyond individual well-being to national productivity and
        sustainability objectives. Their contribution to air pollution undermines Singapore’s ongoing efforts to achieve cleaner
        air, enhance workplace health, and advance its renewable energy and sustainability goals.

          Prioritising the reduction of VOC emissions is therefore essential to safeguard both human health and environmental
          quality. Such efforts are consistent with international health frameworks and Singapore’s local standards, including SS
          554:2016 – Code of Practice for Indoor Air Quality, which prescribes guideline limits for total VOCs and formaldehyde in
          indoor environments (Singapore Standards, n.d.). Given their persistence, prevalence, and well-documented health
          impacts, VOCs remain a critical target for intervention in Singapore’s strategy to improve indoor air quality and
          promote safer, healthier living and working spaces.

          There are currently strategies used to tackle indoor VOC levels, as shown in Figure 1 below. The pyramid displays 5
          different levels of current strategies, which is source control, ventilation, air cleaning, monitoring and behavioural
          controls. The strategies are ranked based on their effectiveness and sustainability, which follows Singapore Standard
          SS554:2016 Code of Practice for indoor air quality, prioritising elimination before ventilation, treatment, behavior and
          control (NEA, n.d.).

            subtitle="Figure 1: Hierarchy pyramid of current strategies tackling VOC."></image-component>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Level 01: Source Control</b><br>This is the most effective strategy, which involves eliminating or reducing the
          sources of pollutants. For example, choosing low-VOC paints and building materials, avoiding the use of strong chemical
          cleaners, and properly maintaining gas appliances to prevent carbon monoxide leaks. This strategy focuses on eliminating
          pollutant emissions by using low-VOC materials, sealing emission sources or substituting hazardous chemicals. However,
          its effectiveness depends heavily on accurate identification of emission sources and availability of non-toxic
          substitutes. In the real environments, many VOCs are continuously released from diverse materials, making complete
          elimination nearly impossible (US EPA, 2025). Even materials certified as low-VOC may become secondary emission sources
          under tropical conditions. For example, higher humidity and temperature accelerate off-gassing and result in prolonged
          re-emissions of VOCs from indoor finishes and furnishings (Yin, Gao, Wei, Wu, &amp; Wang, 2024).<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Level 02: Ventilation</b><br> This involves increasing the amount of fresh outdoor air coming into an indoor space.
          This can be as simple as opening windows and doors, or as technical as using mechanical ventilation systems with
          high-efficiency air filters to bring in clean air and exhaust polluted air. However, its performance is limited in dense
          urban areas where outdoor air quality can already be compromised by traffic emissions or haze. Increasing ventilation
          rates also incurs higher energy consumption for cooling and dehumidification, which contradicts sustainability goals and
          increases operational costs.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Level 04: Monitoring</b><br>Monitoring is a preventive-focused strategy that strengthens VOC management by enabling
          continuous assessment of indoor air quality (IAQ) and early detection of pollutant spikes. Modern VOC monitoring uses
          sensors that track total VOCs (TVOC), formaldehyde, carbon dioxide, and other co-pollutants in real time, allowing
          building managers or occupants to intervene before concentrations reach harmful levels. Research shows that
          integrating IAQ monitoring systems into buildings improves ventilation control, prompt corrective action, and
          long-term exposure reduction (Marcham, Miller, Springston, Hawkins, & Kollmeyer, 2020). Singapore’s SS 554:2016 Code
          of Practice for Indoor Air Quality also recommends routine measurement of TVOC and formaldehyde to maintain healthy
          indoor environments (Singapore Standards, n.d.). With increasing availability of affordable IAQ sensors, monitoring
          serves as an essential layer of protection, ensuring that VOC levels remain within recommended guidelines and enabling
          data-driven air-quality management.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Level 05: Behavioural Controls</b><br>Behavioral controls address VOC pollution by targeting occupant actions that
          directly influence emissions, ventilation habits, and exposure duration. Behavioral strategies include choosing
          low-VOC or fragrance-free products, improving ventilation during pollutant-generating activities, reducing the use of
          chemical-based cleaners, and avoiding unnecessary indoor combustion. Studies show that behavioural interventions alone
          can reduce indoor VOC concentrations by 20–60%, depending on the pollutant source and adherence level (Modupe Mewomo,
          James Olaonipekun Toyin, Comfort Iyiola, & Aluko, 2021). Public awareness campaigns, environmental labeling schemes
          (e.g., Singapore Green Label), and workplace health programs support these behavioural shifts by guiding occupants
          toward safer product choices and good IAQ practices. As the top tier of the mitigation hierarchy, behavioural controls
          reinforce long-term sustainability by addressing VOC production at its behavioural roots.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          While monitoring and behavioural controls are essential components of a comprehensive indoor air-quality strategy,
          monitoring systems, although valuable, only detect and inform users about VOC concentrations. They do not actively
          reduce pollutant loads. Similarly, behavioural controls depend on consistent user compliance, which is often difficult
          to sustain in real-world settings such as offices, homes, and public buildings where occupants have varying awareness
          and habits. Given these behavioural and operational constraints, it is necessary to evaluate whether lower-tier
          measures, source control and ventilation, can sufficiently maintain safe VOC levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current IAQ practice prioritises source control and adequate ventilation, which can significantly lower pollutant
          loads. Source control and ventilation reduce VOC levels by ~55%. However, they are unable to eliminate them fully due
          to the continuous emissions from indoor sources (Joo et al., 2025). A meta-analysis of 77 residential IAQ studies
          found multiple VOCs still exceeding chronic health benchmarks despite typical ventilation rates, indicating that
          source control and dilution alone are insufficient, thus calling for focus on active air-cleaning measures (Logue et
          al., 2011; Mata et al., 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Level 03: Air Cleaning</b><br>Air-cleaning strategies involve using mechanical or chemical devices to remove
          pollutants from indoor air. For particulate matter such as PM₂.₅, High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are
          highly effective because they capture up to 99.97% of particles ≥0.3 μm. However, HEPA filters are unable to remove
          VOCs, as gaseous molecules pass through filter fibres (US EPA, 2022). For VOCs, air purifiers typically rely on
          activated carbon or other sorbent filters, which adsorb gaseous pollutants but do not destroy them. Once saturated,
          these filters can re-release VOCs back into the room, making frequent replacement necessary and generating additional
          waste (ScienceDirect, 2023). Other technologies, such as photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) and UV-based oxidation systems,
          attempt to chemically degrade VOCs but often face issues of incomplete oxidation, which can lead to the formation of
          harmful secondary pollutants (Zhong, Haghighat, & Lee, 2013). PCO units also require continuous high-energy input,
          suffer from catalyst degradation, and may release nanoparticles such as TiO₂ during prolonged operation (R. Sivasankar
          et al., 2018). These limitations make conventional air-cleaning less suitable for long-term, low-cost VOC management in
          typical residential or community settings.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Conventional air-cleaning technologies, including HEPA filters, catalytic oxidation and PCO devices, therefore offer
          targeted but incomplete VOC removal. Their performance is constrained by narrow pollutant specificity, energy demand,
          maintenance requirements, and environmental trade-offs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studies have repeatedly shown that VOC removal efficiencies for activated carbon, PCO, and plasma purifiers vary
          widely, with many systems achieving only modest or inconsistent reductions under real indoor conditions (Messan ,
          2022). In addition, the potential formation of secondary pollutants, particularly aldehydes and ultrafine particles,
          raises concerns about the long-term safety of oxidation-based technologies (R. Sivasankar et al., 2018). Together,
          these persistent limitations of conventional air-cleaning devices, especially their high energy demand, incomplete
          degradation, risk of harmful by-products, and filter-dependent maintenance cycles, underscore the need for safer and
          more sustainable VOC mitigation solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This highlights the need for scalable, sustainable, and nature-based alternatives. Plant–microbe biofiltration systems
          address these gaps by providing continuous, low-cost, and biologically driven VOC removal, making them a promising
          next-generation solution for improving indoor air quality in Singapore’s enclosed and air-conditioned environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plant–microbe systems offer broad-spectrum VOC removal, low energy consumption, and negligible by-product risks. These
          systems metabolise VOCs into harmless end products through biological pathways rather than adsorption or incomplete
          oxidation. This biological synergy expands the range of VOCs that can be removed, including BTEX compounds, alcohols,
          aldehydes, and oxygenated VOCs (Sheoran et al., 2022). Because plant–microbe systems operate passively or with minor
          airflow assistance, they require minimal energy input and avoid the maintenance burden associated with filter
          replacement or catalyst regeneration. Their ability to self-regenerate, adapt to pollutant loads, and benefit indoor
          occupants through biophilic effects further strengthens their suitability as a long-term IAQ strategy.

        <p>
          3. Smart Green Wall
        </p>
          Commercial systems such as the NAAVA Smart Green Wall, as shown in Figure 5, utilize natural plant–microbe
          biofiltration in an active airflow setup. Air is drawn through a soilless growth medium containing plant roots and
          associated microorganisms, where VOCs such as MEK and toluene are absorbed and enzymatically degraded. Studies have
          shown that these systems can achieve VOC removal efficiencies of 50–70% in single-pass tests (Naava, n.d.).
        </p>
          However, their primary drawback is spatial and architectural constraint. Each wall unit requires substantial vertical
          space, a dedicated water and airflow system, and periodic maintenance, which can limit deployment in compact offices,
          classrooms, or high-density residential units. The size of one NAAVA wall is approximately 1003(W) x 2113(H) x 350(D)
          mm, which takes up about the same footprint as a built-in wardrobe in residences (Naava, n.d.). Its large space use
          makes it challenging to integrate in smaller interiors, such as residences and small office areas where floor or wall
          space is limited. Consequently, despite their proven purification potential, scalability and adaptability to diverse
          indoor layouts remain restricted.
        </p>
          While existing plant–microbe biofiltration systems demonstrate promising VOC-removal capabilities, each of them faces
          critical implementation barriers, which highlight the need for a more practical and accessible biological air
          purification system suitable for household and office environments, with the safety, compactness, and adaptability
          required for modern urban interiors.

      <div id="2.1. Research Question">
        <h3>2.1. Research Question</h3>
        <p>
          Plant–microbe systems represent an advanced extension of phytoremediation, harnessing the synergistic relationship
          between plants and their root-associated microorganisms to enhance VOC degradation efficiency (Pliushch &amp; Pliushch,
          2023). Despite this potential, existing implementations remain constrained by limitations in safety, scalability, and
          practicality, underscoring the need for systems that are durable, low-maintenance, and easily adoptable in real-world
          settings (Aydogan, 2020).<br>
        <p>
          Building upon these insights, this project seeks to explore the potential of developing a
          safe, practical and accessible biological air purification system suitable for household environments. Specifically, the
          study aims to address the research question:
        <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em 0;">
          “Which commercially available indoor plant and microbe pairing
          demonstrates the greatest VOC reduction efficiency among the five most common indoor VOCs
          (Formaldehyde, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylene)?”
        </p>
          By investigating this question, the project aims to identify an optimal
          plant–microbe combination that offers a sustainable, low-cost, and effective solution for improving indoor air quality
          in everyday living spaces.<br><br>

      <div id="3. Phase 1: Plant Selection">
        <h2>3. Phase 1: Plant Selection (Pearlyn)</h2>
        <p>
          The first phase of the project focuses on identifying indoor plant species that can most effectively remove VOCs from
          enclosed environments. To achieve this, a systematic research approach was adopted to shortlist suitable plants for
          subsequent experimentation.
        </p>
          The plant selection process began with an industrial review to identify species currently used in commercially available
          plant-based air purification systems. These industry findings provided practical insights into plant performance under
          real-world indoor conditions. Building upon this foundation, the review was expanded to include secondary research from
          academic and organizational studies, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of documented VOC removal capabilities
          across a wide range of species.
        </p>    
          From this combined body of research, a comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate reported VOC removal efficiencies.
          Plant species that consistently demonstrated lower performance or limited removal capability were excluded, refining the
          pool to those with higher and more reliable purification potential.
        </p>
          Following this performance-based screening, the remaining candidates were further evaluated according to a defined set
          of selection criteria — availability, suitability to Singapore’s indoor climate, and ease of maintenance. These criteria
          ensure that the shortlisted species are not only effective in VOC removal but also practical and sustainable for
          long-term indoor application. The following diagram (Figure 8) summarizes this selection framework.
        </p>
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/3-Plant Selection/Plant Selection Criteria.png"
            subtitle="Figure 8: Hierarchy of the Selection Criteria for suitable plant species."></image-component>
        </p>
        This multi-stage selection process ensured that the final list of candidate plants not only demonstrated scientific
        potential for VOC removal, but also satisfied practical considerations for real-world implementation in residential and
        commercial indoor spaces.
        </p>
        Based on the established selection criteria, four plant species were shortlisted for subsequent testing in the pilot
        study and proof-of-concept phases (Phase 2 and Phase 3): <i> Sansevieria trifasciata</i> (Snake Plant), <i> Epipremnum aureum</i> (Money
        Plant), <i>Zamioculcas zamiifolia</i> (ZZ Plant), and <i> Dracaena fragrans</i> (Dragon Plant).
        </p>
          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/3-Plant Selection/Shortlisted Plants.png"
            subtitle="Figure 9: Photos of Shortlisted Plant Species."></image-component>
        </p>
          The selection of these species was guided by two primary considerations. First, consistent VOC removal performance —
          these plants were repeatedly identified in both scientific literature and commercial reports as effective species for
          VOC mitigation (see Appendix 1), thereby supporting their inclusion based on validated evidence. Second, ease of
          maintenance and resilience — the shortlisted plants are hardy, low-maintenance species capable of thriving under typical
          indoor environmental conditions. Their adaptability to Lightweight Expanded Clay Aggregate (LECA) as a growth medium
          further reinforces their practicality for real-world applications.
        </p>
          These combined characteristics make the selected species well-suited for the pilot study and proof-of-concept phases,
          where the primary objective is to validate the feasibility, robustness, and reliability of the experimental setup under
          simulated indoor conditions.

        <h2>4. Phase 2: Pilot Study (Pearlyn)</h2>
        <p>
          Phase 2 focuses on validating the feasibility of our experimental setup and reliability of our method of analysis
          through a pilot study. This phase serves as a crucial bridge between preliminary plant screening and subsequent
          microbial investigations, ensuring that our experimental framework is both robust and scientifically sound before
          advancing to larger-scale testing.
        </p>
        A pilot study was conducted within the chamber over 24-hour test cycles to assess and refine the experimental setup. The
        objectives of this study are:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>To evaluate the feasibility of the experimental design<br></li>
          <li>To determine the appropriate amount of pollutants to be used<br></li>
          <li>To establish the optimal duration for each experimental run<br></li>
          <li>To identify any potential issues or gaps in the setup that may affect the accuracy or reliability of subsequent
            experiments.<br></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        By achieving these objectives, the pilot study generates critical insights that inform subsequent refinements to the
        experimental setup and strengthen the reliability of data analysis in later phases. The pilot study adopts a cyclical
        experimental framework (Figure 10), beginning with the definition of key parameters such as pollutant dosage. Experiments
        are then conducted and systematically evaluated to identify gaps, inconsistencies, or methodological limitations. Based
        on these observations, necessary adjustments are implemented, and the process is repeated until optimal experimental
        conditions are established — where pollutant concentrations fall within the sensor’s detection range while remaining
        sufficiently high to allow discernible differences in VOC removal efficiency.

      <p>
        Elmer’s White Glue was selected as a primary pollutant source because it contains all five target VOCs, enabling
        simultaneous assessment of multiple compounds within a single material. However, its high viscosity restricts solvent
        mobility and diffusion, leading to slower VOC evaporation rates. Such behaviour is typical of viscous polymeric coatings
        and adhesives, where internal mass transfer resistance limits emission flux (Munekata et al., 2013). If only white glue
        were used, the slower VOC emission would likely prolong the time required for concentrations in the chamber to reach a
        plateau, potentially delaying the observation of measurable VOC removal by the plant and plant–microbe setups. To
        address this limitation and ensure sufficient VOC exposure during the experimental period, additional pollutant sources
        with differing physical properties were incorporated.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Aureo’s Liquid Shoe Polish was incorporated as a complementary VOC source due to its low viscosity, which facilitates
        more rapid evaporation compared with white glue. This characteristic ensures that the chamber reaches measurable VOC
        concentrations more quickly, enabling timely observation of VOC removal by the plant and plant–microbe setups. In
        addition, the shoe polish provides a concentrated source of Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylene, broadening the spectrum
        of VOCs present and reflecting the diverse chemical profile commonly found in indoor environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nippon Vinilex‑5000 water-based paint was added to supplement the Formaldehyde content, which is released more slowly
        from high-viscosity white glue. Even though it is a low-VOC formulation, paint contributes an additional, readily
        available source of Formaldehyde, helping to balance the relative concentrations of all five target VOCs in the chamber.
        The inclusion of paint also strengthens the experimental design by preventing reliance on a single pollutant type,
        reducing potential bias due to the physical and chemical properties unique to one material. This approach ensures that
        the experimental conditions more accurately mimic real-world indoor settings, where VOCs originate from multiple sources
        such as adhesives, paints, and personal care products.
      </p>
        To determine the appropriate volume of each pollutant to be introduced into the experimental chamber, a preliminary
        calculation was performed to estimate the target mass of VOCs required. This calculation was based on reference
        experimental setups from Natede et al. (2023) and is detailed in Appendix 2.
      <p>
        Using reference experimental setups from Natede et al. (2023), a preliminary calculation was performed to estimate the
        target mass of VOCs required for the experimental chamber (see Appendix 2). Based on this value, the required volume of
        each pollutant was determined using Microsoft Excel’s Solver function to ensure that the total VOC mass matched the
        calculated target. The resulting volumes for each pollutant are summarized in Table 2.

      <p> 
        Although the calculated volumes in Table 2 provide a theoretical reference for estimating the expected VOC
        concentrations, the pilot study was intentionally conducted using 2.5 mL of each pollutant instead of the calculated
        values. This choice was made for two primary reasons. Firstly, 2.5 mL is the minimum volume that can be measured
        accurately and consistently with the available measuring cups, ensuring precision and reproducibility. Secondly, using a
        slightly higher volume compensates for the simplifying assumption in the preliminary calculations that all VOCs would
        evaporate fully within the chamber. In practice, VOC volatilization depends on factors such as viscosity, diffusion, and
        available surface area, meaning that complete evaporation may not occur. Therefore, 2.5 mL was selected as a practical
        and conservative starting volume to ensure that VOC concentrations in the chamber were sufficiently high to detect and
        compare the removal performance of the plant and plant–microbe setups, while still using Table 3 strictly as a
        theoretical guide rather than an exact dosing requirement.

      <p>
        The plant container was prepared to ensure consistent experimental conditions and to facilitate effective plant–microbe
        interaction for VOC removal. To optimize pollutant exposure to the plant roots, the container was modified by cutting an
        opening and installing a computer fan, which directs airflow from the pollutant source toward the LECA and root zone
        (Figure 12). This arrangement ensures that VOCs pass through the rhizosphere, maximizing contact with both the plant and
        microbial components.

        LECA balls were carefully washed prior to use to remove any surface contaminants that could interfere with the results.
        The container was filled with LECA to approximately 80% of its volume, maintaining uniform growth medium across all
        setups (Figure 13).
      </p>
      <p>
        A volume of 250 mL of water was added to each container to ensure consistent hydration (Figure 13), and the same volume
        (250 mL) of microbial solution was introduced to the plant–microbe setups. The addition of microbes to the rhizosphere
        enhances VOC degradation by metabolizing compounds absorbed by the plant roots, thereby improving overall removal
        efficiency.

        Accurate measurement of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of each
        plant–microbe pairing. To ensure reliable data collection, the Awair Element air quality monitor was selected for use in
        this study. The Awair Element is recognized as one of the most accurate and reliable commercially available indoor
        air-quality sensors , capable of detecting a wide range of pollutants including TVOCs, CO₂, and particulate matter
        (Shipped F, n.d.).
      </p>
      <p>  
        Calibration of the sensors was conducted under outdoor ambient conditions for a continuous 24-hour period to establish a
        stable and accurate baseline. This baseline provides a reference for detecting changes in VOC levels within the enclosed
        chamber during subsequent experiments. To enhance calibration consistency, two Awair Element sensors were placed facing
        each other during the calibration process as shown in Figure 12. This arrangement ensured that both devices sampled the
        same air mass, minimizing discrepancies due to airflow direction or localized variations in pollutant concentration.

      <p>
        Following outdoor calibration, the sensors were allowed to stabilize briefly under indoor conditions before each
        experimental run. This step ensured that all sensors started from comparable baseline readings, improving measurement
        precision and repeatability across tests.

        <h3>4.1.4 Chamber Modification</h3>
      <p>
        In designing the experimental chamber, several factors were considered to ensure appropriate plant growth and accurate
        VOC measurements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chamber size was selected based on several practical and methodological considerations. First, the height of the
        chamber was chosen to accommodate the combined height of the plant and its container, ensuring that the plant remained
        upright and unobstructed during the experiment. Second, the base area of the chamber had to be sufficiently large to
        position both the pollutant source and the sensor far apart, minimizing the risk of the sensor detecting artificially
        elevated VOC levels from direct release rather than from the ambient chamber environment. At the same time, the chamber
        could not be excessively large, as a greater internal volume would dilute the VOC concentration and prolong the time
        needed to reach measurable steady-state levels. Therefore, a moderate-sized transparent chamber (H: 56 cm × B: 39 cm ×
        L: 42 cm) was chosen to balance spatial requirements, measurement accuracy, and experimental efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        A transparent plastic chamber was also selected to simulate indoor conditions, providing natural light to the plants
        while avoiding complete darkness, which could adversely affect plant metabolism and VOC uptake. Transparency also
        facilitated visual monitoring of plant health throughout the experiment.

      <p>
        Following the 24-hour pilot study using 2.5 mL of each pollutant, TVOC measurements indicated that the pollutant sources
        emitted a substantial concentration of VOCs within the chamber. Examination of the VOC decay profiles revealed that both
        the plant-only and plant–microbe setups contributed to VOC removal, consistent with the expected role of
        phytoremediation. The plant–microbe setup demonstrated a slightly higher removal efficiency compared to plants alone,
        achieving a 96% reduction in TVOC levels, versus 95% for the plant-only setup.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Additionally, the time required for the plant–microbe system to reach steady state was approximately 33% shorter than
        that of the plant-only system. This observation aligns with theoretical expectations that microbial activity in the
        rhizosphere enhances VOC degradation: microbes can metabolize compounds absorbed by plant roots, thereby accelerating
        the overall removal process. The marginally higher removal efficiency and faster stabilization observed in the
        plant–microbe setup provide experimental evidence supporting the synergistic effect of plant–microbe interactions in VOC
        mitigation.

        <h3>4.3. Experimental Improvements and Methodology Refinement</h3>
        <p>
          During this process, several important considerations for improving the setup and methodology of analysis were
          identified, including adjustments to pollutant volume, accounting for background VOCs emitted by the chamber material,
          and ensuring consistent sensor calibration and placement.
        </p>  
          Firstly, when 2.5 mL of each pollutant was introduced into the chamber, the TVOC levels reached 37,216.6 ppb, which
          exceeded the sensor’s upper limit of 36,000 ppb (AWAIR support, 2023). After varying pollutant volumes, we determined
          that using 1 mL of each pollutant maintained the TVOC concentration within the sensor’s detectable range (29,103.4 ppb)
          while still producing a clear difference in VOC removal between setups. Hence, 1 mL of each pollutant was selected as
          the standardized dosage for subsequent experiments.

      </div>
        <p>
          Secondly, a control test conducted using an empty chamber showed a gradual increase in TVOC levels even in the
          absence of added pollutants (Figure 13 - 'empty'). This is likely due to the emission of VOCs from the polypropylene
          chamber material, which can occur when the plastic is exposed to ultraviolet light. It is important to note that the
          VOCs released from polypropylene are not among the FBTEX compounds targeted in this study (Kang et al., 2020).
          However, because the sensors used measure total VOC (TVOC) concentration without differentiating between
          compound types, these background emissions may still influence the readings. To minimize this effect, each
          experimental condition will be repeated multiple times, and the average values will be used for analysis.
          Since these background VOCs are not chemically related to the FBTEX compounds of interest, they are not
          expected to affect the comparative assessment of plant–microbe pairings.
        </p>
          Lastly, we observed slight differences in the starting VOC levels across different setups. These variations are likely
          caused by differences in the time taken to seal the chamber or by residual VOCs that remained despite ventilation
          between runs. As a result, direct comparison of absolute VOC readings between experiments may not provide an accurate
          representation of removal performance. To ensure fair comparison, all future analyses will instead be based on the
          relative change in VOC concentration from the starting point of each experiment.
