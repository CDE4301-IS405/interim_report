        <h3>1.1 Sub-section 1 IAQ (example only)</h3>
        <p>
          Air quality is fundamental to human health and well-being.
          The air we breathe influences a wide range of physiological functions, including respiratory,
          cardiovascular, and cognitive systems (<a
            href="https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-energy-and-health/health-impacts">World
            Health Organisation, n.d.</a>).
          Traditionally, the
          focus has been on outdoor air pollution, since its effects are visible through smog, haze,
          and poor air indices, and it has been established as a major global health risk. Indoor air
          quality remains a neglected aspect of environmental health (Dcarrick, 2025). Unlike outdoor
          air pollution, which is visible through haze or measurable by public indices, indoor pollutants
          are often invisible and odorless, making them harder to detect and easier to overlook.

        <h3>2.1. Research Question</h3>
        <p>
          Plant–microbe systems represent an advanced extension of phytoremediation, harnessing the synergistic relationship
          between plants and their root-associated microorganisms to enhance VOC degradation efficiency (Pliushch &amp; Pliushch,
          2023). Despite this potential, existing implementations remain constrained by limitations in safety, scalability, and
          practicality, underscoring the need for systems that are durable, low-maintenance, and easily adoptable in real-world
          settings (Aydogan, 2020).<br>
        <p>
          Building upon these insights, this project seeks to explore the potential of developing a
          safe, practical and accessible biological air purification system suitable for household environments. Specifically, the
          study aims to address the research question:
        <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em 0;">
          “Which commercially available indoor plant and microbe pairing
          demonstrates the greatest VOC reduction efficiency among the five most common indoor VOCs
          (formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene)?”
        </p>
          By investigating this question, the project aims to identify an optimal
          plant–microbe combination that offers a sustainable, low-cost, and effective solution for improving indoor air quality
          in everyday living spaces.<br><br>

      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-2-header-2">
        <h3>2.2. Project Phases</h3>
        <p>
          To systematically address the research question, the study was structured into 5 sequential phases, as illustrated in
          Figure X. Each phase builds upon the findings of the previous one to progressively narrow down the most effective
          plant–microbe pairing for VOC removal. The overall research framework integrates plant screening, pilot testing, proof
          of concept validation, microbial identification, and final pairing evaluation to ensure a comprehensive and
          evidence-based approach.

        <h2>3. Phase 1: Plant Selection (Pearlyn)</h2>
        <p>
          The first phase of the project focuses on identifying indoor plant species that can most effectively remove VOCs from
          enclosed environments. To achieve this, a systematic research approach was adopted to shortlist suitable plants for
          subsequent experimentation.
        </p>
          The plant selection process began with an industrial review to identify species currently used in commercially available
          plant-based air purification systems. These industry findings provided practical insights into plant performance under
          real-world indoor conditions. Building upon this foundation, the review was expanded to include secondary research from
          academic and organizational studies, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of documented VOC removal capabilities
          across a wide range of species.
        </p>    
          From this combined body of research, a comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate reported VOC removal efficiencies.
          Plant species that consistently demonstrated lower performance or limited removal capability were excluded, refining the
          pool to those with higher and more reliable purification potential.
          Following this performance-based screening, the remaining candidates were further evaluated according to a defined set
          of selection criteria — availability, suitability to Singapore’s indoor climate, and ease of maintenance. These criteria
          ensure that the shortlisted species are not only effective in VOC removal but also practical and sustainable for
          long-term indoor application. The following diagram (Figure X) summarizes this selection framework.

        <h2>4. Phase 2: Pilot Study (Pearlyn)</h2>
        <p>
          Phase 2 focuses on validating the feasibility of our experimental setup and reliability of our method of analysis
          through a pilot study. This phase serves as a crucial bridge between preliminary plant screening and subsequent
          microbial investigations, ensuring that our experimental framework is both robust and scientifically sound before
          advancing to larger-scale testing.
        </p>
        A pilot study was conducted within the chamber over 24-hour test cycles to assess and refine the experimental setup. The
        objectives of this study are:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>To evaluate the feasibility of the experimental design<br></li>
          <li>To determine the appropriate amount of pollutants to be used<br></li>
          <li>To establish the optimal duration for each experimental run<br></li>
          <li>To identify any potential issues or gaps in the setup that may affect the accuracy or reliability of subsequent
            experiments.<br></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        By achieving these objectives, the pilot study generates critical insights that inform subsequent refinements to the
        experimental setup and strengthen the reliability of data analysis in later phases. The pilot study adopts a cyclical
        experimental framework (Fig. X), beginning with the definition of key parameters such as pollutant dosage. Experiments
        are then conducted and systematically evaluated to identify gaps, inconsistencies, or methodological limitations. Based
        on these observations, necessary adjustments are implemented, and the process is repeated until optimal experimental
        conditions are established — where pollutant concentrations fall within the sensor’s detection range while remaining
        sufficiently high to allow discernible differences in VOC removal efficiency.

                <h4>Operational Principles:</h4>
                <p>The circulation system maintains homogeneous air composition within the chamber, preventing stratification and ensuring accurate sensor readings. The gentle airflow mimics natural convection patterns in indoor environments without creating turbulent conditions that might stress the plant specimen.</p>

                <h4>Control Methodology:</h4>
                <p>Flow rate is calibrated using a digital flowmeter and adjusted based on chamber volume (approximately 40 liters) to achieve one complete air exchange every 40-80 minutes, matching typical indoor ventilation rates.</p>

                <p><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Pump operation is continuously monitored to ensure consistent performance throughout experimental trials.</p>

          Secondly, a control test conducted using an empty chamber showed a gradual increase in TVOC levels even in the
          absence of added pollutants. This is likely due to the emission of VOCs from the polypropylene chamber
          material, which can occur when the plastic is exposed to ultraviolet light. It is important to note that the
          VOCs released from polypropylene are not among the FBTEX compounds targeted in this study (Kang et al., 2020).
          However, because the sensors used measure total VOC (TVOC) concentration without differentiating between
          compound types, these background emissions may still influence the readings. To minimize this effect, each
          experimental condition will be repeated multiple times, and the average values will be used for analysis.
          Since these background VOCs are not chemically related to the FBTEX compounds of interest, they are not
          expected to affect the comparative assessment of plant–microbe pairings.
          Lastly, we observed slight differences in the starting VOC levels across different setups. These variations
          are likely caused by differences in the time taken to seal the chamber or by residual VOCs that remained
          despite ventilation between runs. As a result, direct comparison of absolute VOC readings between experiments
          may not provide an accurate representation of removal performance. To ensure fair comparison, all future
          analyses will instead be based on the relative change in VOC concentration from the starting point of each
          experiment.
